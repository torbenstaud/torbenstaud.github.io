Scientific Projects
===================

* Statistical inference on models for non-stationary extremes — ***ongoing research***
* Developed an `R` package with a `C++` backend for bootstrapping block maxima, published on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=maxbootR)
* Bootstrapping block maxima estimators for time series — resulted in a [publication](../_publications/extremes_bootstrap.md) in the ***Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B***
* On the maximal correlation coefficient for the bivariate Marshall–Olkin distribution — resulted in a [publication](../_publications/mo_maxcorr.md) in ***Statistics & Probability Letters***
* U-statistics of block maxima for time series — resulted in a [publication](../_publications/extreme_u_stats.md) in the ***Electronic Journal of Statistics***

Grants
===================

* International research stay grant — funding for my project proposal *Sliding block maxima under non-stationarities*. Included a 2-month stay in Belgium at the [ISBA](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam/isba) under the supervision of [Prof. Johan Segers](https://perso.uclouvain.be/johan.segers/). **Awarded to Torben Staud**
* Heinrich Heine University stipend — performance-based award funded by Provinzial Rheinland Versicherungen AG. **Awarded to Torben Staud**
* [DFG project](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/465665892) — funding of my Ph.D. for three years. **Awarded to Prof. Axel Bücher**
