Scientific projects
======
* Bootstrapping block maxima estimators in time series (finished in 2024 and resulted in a [submission](../_publications/extremes_bootstrap.md) to TBD
* U-Statistics of block maxima in time series (finished in 2023 and resulted in a [publication](../_publications/extreme_u_stats.md) in the renown Electronical Journal of Statistics)


Skills
======
* **Statistics**: 5 years of experience in applied an mathematical statistics (point estimation, confidence bands, bootstrapping, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, surival analysis, monte carlo simulations, Markov chains)
* **R**: Experience of 4 years scientific work comprising: Planning, coneption and conduction of large scale monte carlo simulation studies; Rcpp optimization; HPC incorporation; unit testing; microbenchmarking
* **C++**: Coding of mathematical functions, porting to R
* **Bash**: Scripting for High Performance Computing
* **Markdown**: Creation of website texts (like my homepage you are seeing right now)
* **Java**: Full semester extracurricular course (10CP) of Java programming (Grade 1.3)
* **Statistical Data Analysis**: Full semester extracurricular course (5CP) of conducting statistical analyses (Grade 1.0)
* **High dimensional statistics**: Multiple years experience using machine learning, data science and deep learning algorithms as clustering; lasso-/ridge regression; k-nearest neighbours; neural networks; Chat-GPT prompting
* **Github**: Usage for project management and version controll of programming projects and simulation studies
