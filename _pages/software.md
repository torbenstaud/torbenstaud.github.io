I published and authored an R-package called **maxbootR** which enables the efficient bootstrapping of block maxima based estimators. It is available on **CRAN** and a detailed beginner-friendly tutorial is availabe on its corresponding [pkgdown site](https://torbenstaud.github.io/maxbootR/).

The sensitive parts of coding are done via fast C++ backends and the underlying theory stems from our paper on bootstrapping block maxima. BÃ¼cher, A. & Staud, T. (2024+). Bootstrapping estimators based on the block maxima method: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05529).
