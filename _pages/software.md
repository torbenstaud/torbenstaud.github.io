I published and authored an R-package called **maxbootR** which enables the efficient bootstrapping of block maxima based estimators. It is available on **CRAN** and a detailed beginner-friendly tutorial is availabe on its corresponding [pkgdown site](https://torbenstaud.github.io/maxbootR/).

The sensitive parts of coding are done via fast C++ backends and the underlying theory stems from our paper on bootstrapping block maxima. 'BÃ¼cher, A., Staud, T. (2025). &quot;Bootstrapping Estimators based on the Block Maxima Method&quot; <i>To appear in: Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B (Statistical Methodology)</i>'
