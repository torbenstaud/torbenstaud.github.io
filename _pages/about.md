Welcome to my website. I am a post doctoral research assistant at the Chair of Mathematical Statistics, [Ruhr University Bochum](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-buecher/) and together with my great mentor [Professor Dr. Axel Bücher](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-buecher/staff/axel-buecher/) we form the task force working on [Statistical inference for extremes based on sliding block maxima](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/465665892) which is a DFG funded project. Furthermore, together with Professor Bücher and the outstanding [Professor Dr. Johan Segers](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00019313) from the KU Leuven I am working on a project on [non-stationary extremes](https://research.kuleuven.be/portal/en/project/3E241012) important for climatological applications. The latter project was financially supported by the RUB Research School.
