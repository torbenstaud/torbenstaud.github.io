Welcome! I’m a **consultant at d-fine**, where I bring analytical thinking and statistical expertise into data-driven solutions for complex real-world problems.

Before joining d-fine, I completed my PhD in **Extreme Value Statistics** at the universities of Düsseldorf and Bochum, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Axel Bücher](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-buecher/staff/axel-buecher/).  
My research focused on developing new methods to quantify uncertainty in the face of rare and high-impact events – such as financial crises or extreme weather.  

Along the way, I published in international journals, presented at conferences across Europe, and completed a funded research stay in Belgium.

If you're curious, here’s my [Curriculum Vitae](https://torbenstaud.github.io/cv/).
<!-- Welcome to my website. I am a post doctoral research assistant at the Chair of Mathematical Statistics, [Ruhr University Bochum](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-buecher/) and together with my great mentor [Professor Dr. Axel Bücher](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-buecher/staff/axel-buecher/) we form the task force working on [Statistical inference for extremes based on sliding block maxima](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/465665892) which is a DFG funded project. Furthermore, together with Professor Bücher and the outstanding [Professor Dr. Johan Segers](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00019313) from the KU Leuven I am working on a project on [non-stationary extremes](https://research.kuleuven.be/portal/en/project/3E241012) important for climatological applications. The latter project was financially supported by the RUB Research School. 

My research interests include
------
1. Efficient Algorithms for Extreme Value Statistics
2. High Performance Computing in Applied Statistics
3. Resampling and Bootstrap Methods in non-standard settings
4. Extreme Value Statistics of (Non-)Stationary Time Series
5. Mathematical and Applied Statistics
