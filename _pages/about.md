Welcome to my website. I am a doctoral student at the Chair of Mathematical Statistics, [Ruhr University Bochum](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-buecher/) and I form with my advisor [Professor Dr. Axel BÃ¼cher's](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-buecher/team/axel-buecher/) the team working on [Statistical inference for extremes based on sliding block maxima](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/465665892) which is a DFG funded project.
