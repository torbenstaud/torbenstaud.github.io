Welcome to my website. I am a doctoral student at the Chair of Mathematical Statistics, [Ruhr University Bochum](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-buecher/) and part of [Professor Dr. Axel Bücher's](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-buecher/team/axel-buecher/) work group in Mathematical Statistics. From 2021 to 2023 I did research at the University of Dusseldorf. When my doctoral supervisor Professor Bücher moved from the University of Düsseldorf to the Ruhr University, I followed.
