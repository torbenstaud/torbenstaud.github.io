I gave a [talk](../files/non_stat.pdf) on estimating parameters in non-stationary general models with fixed covariates. These abstract models include a variety of interesting applications, as conditional maximum likelihood estimators in irregular models; optimal scoring; pairwise likelihood etc.

The talk is based on joint work with Axel BÃ¼cher and Johan Segers, and the manuscript will be submitted for publication this year (2025).
