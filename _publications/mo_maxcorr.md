We prove a formula for the maximal correlation coefficient of the bivariate Marshall Olkin distribution that was conjectured in Lin, Lai, and Govindaraju (2016, Stat. Methodol., 29:1–9). The formula is applied to obtain a new proof for a variance inequality in extreme value statistics that links the disjoint and the sliding block maxima method.
